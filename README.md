**scripts-fabq** is a collection of useful scripts and notes aimed at streamlining command-line operations and improving productivity. This repository is currently incomplete, as I am in the slow process of adding notes and scripts that are stored in closed-source repositories as I revise them.

## üìö Overview

This repository is structured into several key directories:

- **scripts/**: Contains individual scripts for various tasks. Currently, it includes:

  - `video_remove_audio.py`: A script for removing audio from video files.

- **notes/**: A collection of markdown files containing notes on various topics, including:

  - `brother.md`: Information about Brother printers on Linux.
  - `chrome-driver.md`: Notes on ChromeDriver setup and usage on Linux.
  - `dns.md`: DNS configuration and troubleshooting.
  - `pdftk.md`: PDF Toolkit usage.
  - `ssh.md`: Secure Shell (SSH) configuration and tips.
  - `btrfs.md`: Btrfs filesystem configuration and tips.
  - `debian packaging.md`: Debian packaging guidelines.
  - `linux.md`: General Linux tips.
  - `pip packaging.md`: Packaging Python projects with pip.

- **pages/other/**: Templates for other pages, such as the homepage of my Debian package repository. These are provided as inspiration and should not be used as-is.

- **pages/errors/**: Templates for error pages. These are provided as inspiration and should not be used as-is.

- **requests/**: Similar to the `pages/` directory, this contains error pages structured as requests for software like HAProxy.
